>> on label embedding
    1.Change the label embedding dim, as acc to DDP 
    2.Change the current embedding to one hot vector embedding 
>> On time dimension
    1. Change it to 16, as acc to DDP 
>> Number of schedule steps 
    1. Change it to 10 steps
    2. Change it to 5 steps 
    # Can check at each step improvement in terms of miou
>> mutual information based noise scheduling type
    1. change it to cosine
